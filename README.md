Accelerometer based tennis game
*******************************************************************************

This code demonstrates the use of accelerometer and LEDs to create a simple 
tennis game. The four LEDs turn on in a series representing the movement of the
the tennis ball. When the fourth LED turns ON, the player returns back the ball
by tilting the board. The accelerometer captures this movement and LEDs are 
turned on in the reverse series to represent the return movement of the ball. 
The game ends if the player misses tilting the board at the right moment 3 
times. The switches on the board are used to start/stop the game.

Freescale M52233DEMO low-cost development board is used for this project.
